Ever wondered how the online assessments feels like a strict invigilator behind the screen :cold_sweat:
Reading through files in the repository will get you a basic idea on how object detection can be done on real time using your webcam, which can have various applications, one of which is Exam Proctoring. 
Stepwise description on how the program works:
<ul>
  <li>The project is built on Google Colab, where webcam is accessed using its inbuilt functionalities.</li>
  <li>OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face and eye detection.</li>
  <li>Ultralytics YoloV8 for object and human detection (like smartphone, multiple persons, books) on the image captured using webcam.</li>
  <li>Output list generated by our model Yolov8n.pt is traversed, which contains information about the model and the image processed through it.</li>
  <li>If the output list contains texts which may not be suitable while attempting an online assessment, like two or more persons in room, book, phone, etc, then a warning string will be generated as output.</li>
  <li>Display of the output image with rectangular boxes around the objects detected.</li>
</ul>
